# setuper

CLI application to automatize an enviroment setup, wich includes
customize the theme, colors, terminal, programs and dotfiles.

Created to setup [my dotfiles](https://github.com/iagotito/dotfiles)
into an Ubuntu enviroment, but I could evolve to be more flexible...
Beging honest, I will probably never do this though.
